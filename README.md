# Brand-Tone-Trainer
This website is a tone-prompting tool. Based on the brand’s desired promotional voice, it searches for and summarizes the target brand’s commonly used tone, provides several examples, and also highlights words and phrases to avoid. The primary audience is people with product marketing needs, as well as anyone who wants to create content or write copy. The site analyzes the brand’s past marketing copy and brand story, then delivers a summary. At the end, it lists high-frequency words that appear often, along with words that should be avoided.

How to Use:
* Enter the brand name you want to analyze
* Click **“Generate Tone”**

I used the Gemini API because it offers strong text generation and can quickly produce consistent content based on my prompts and constraints. I also used Claude and ChatGPT as my AI coding assistants when my HTML and CSS did not achieve the expected results. During later-stage debugging, I frequently ran into JSON encoding/decoding errors, and I used Claude to help me fix and refine the code.

Reflection:
With the help of an AI assistant, I was able to delegate many coding issues directly to Claude, which saved me a lot of time and reduced the need to repeatedly search for solutions. However, I still ran into several challenges. The most frustrating one was JSON formatting issues, which prevented the webpage from properly parsing and displaying the generated information. As a result, I sometimes had to rely on pre-stored HTML templates, which was also a headache. Through continuous adjustments and improvements to the overall structure, I believe I have largely resolved this problem.

For a 2.0 version, I would be very interested in improving readability by making the interface more concise and possibly adding images to enhance the overall user experience.
